# Rust Serde Deserialization Example

This Rust project demonstrates deserialization using the `serde` crate. The project consists of two main files: `main.rs` and `messages.rs`.

## Project Structure

- `main.rs`: The main entry point of the application. It includes the logic for deserializing a JSON string into Rust structs.
- `messages.rs`: Contains the definitions of the structs used for deserialization and their associated constants.
